name: ship-heliofits
description: Full HelioFITS release pipeline: version bump, conditional libcfitsio.a rebuild, tests on both arches, changelog (two-tier), tag, ship.sh (Developer ID + notarize + GitHub release), and the Mac App Store archive + upload. Use whenever Gilly says "ship a patch/release", "cut a new version", "publish vX.Y.Z", "ship this as build N", or asks to deploy/release HelioFITS. Also use when Gilly says "update the apple store" or asks to sync the App Store listing text from STORE.md (scripts/store_sync.py). Do NOT use for a single code fix with no release attached, or for other repos.

# ship-heliofits

Runs the HelioFITS release pipeline end to end, stopping at the confirmation
gate before anything public-facing. The authoritative procedure is
[RELEASING.md](../../../RELEASING.md) at the repo root — read it if anything
here seems to disagree with it; RELEASING.md wins.

This is a **runbook** in the sense defined by the global `runbook` skill:
procedure doc + operational checklist + a tracker that verifies real external
state. If you are changing the shape of this file rather than its content,
read that skill's design notes first.

## What this skill can finish unattended

Everything through "build N is uploaded and Processing in App Store Connect."
No password, credential, or GUI click is required for any of it.

## What it cannot finish without Gilly in the loop

Creating the version record, attaching the build, writing What's New, and
confirming screenshots are automatable once an App Store Connect API key
exists (see [scripts/asc_api.py](scripts/asc_api.py) and "App Store Connect API
key: scope and terms" below). With no key configured this whole tier is
unavailable: hand off to the manual App Store Connect flow instead.

**Hard gate, independent of what's automated: never call Add for Review,
Submit to Review, or Release This Version without asking Gilly in chat first
and getting an explicit yes, every single time.** This is not a one-time
grant — a "yes" for build N does not cover build N+1. These are the actions
that make a release visible to the public or to Apple's review queue, and
per the standing safety rules for this project they require confirmation
per action, not standing authorization. Preparing everything up to that
point (version record, build, metadata, screenshots) does NOT require
per-step confirmation — only the final publish/submit action does. State
plainly what is about to happen ("this will submit build 8 of 1.3.1 for App
Review") rather than a vague "should I continue?".

If no API key is configured, all of this stays manual: hand off after
upload and say plainly that the release is not live until Gilly creates the
version record and clicks through Submit to Review himself.

## App Store Connect API key: scope and terms

A key is configured (as of 2026-08-22): Key ID `4QPRA2KW39`, Issuer ID
`7b467b82-5579-417f-aa7e-b7d16f47f8d9`, role App Manager, `.p8` at
`~/.claude/secrets/appstoreconnect/AuthKey_4QPRA2KW39.p8` (mode 600, outside
any git-tracked tree). `scripts/asc_api.py` in this skill signs the ES256 JWT
and calls the API — `python3 scripts/asc_api.py GET /v1/apps/6790952544/builds`
etc. GET calls are safe to run freely; anything that mutates ASC state goes
through the confirmation gate below regardless of which script does the
mutating. Verified 2026-08-22: `GET /v1/apps` and `GET .../builds` both work
and correctly resolve to HelioFITS (app id `6790952544`).

If it was issued, it's under Apple's "internal development, testing, and
reporting" terms for a single team. Keep usage inside that scope, always:

- The key and any JWT derived from it go to Apple's App Store Connect API
  endpoints ONLY. Never log it, never include it in a commit, never send it
  or its contents to any other service.
- It is for HelioFITS, under Gilly's own account. Don't reuse it for another
  app or another person's project, and don't treat it as something that can
  be shared outside Gilly's team.
- This does not relax the confirmation gate above. A working API key makes
  more of the pipeline automatable; it does not make Submit to Review or
  Release This Version automatic.

## Listing text: "update the apple store"

`STORE.md` is the source of truth for the listing text. `scripts/store_sync.py`
syncs it to App Store Connect, en-US only: name, subtitle, promotional text,
description, keywords, What's New, support and marketing URLs. Screenshots,
review notes, Submit and Release are not handled.

1. Diff, GET calls only, safe unasked:
   `python3 .claude/skills/ship-heliofits/scripts/store_sync.py`
   It prints each field whose live text differs from STORE.md (whitespace and
   line wrapping alone are not a change), then `pending: ...; blocked: ...`.
   Exit 0 nothing to do, 2 changes pending, 1 failure, 3 UNCHECKED (no key or
   App Store Connect unreachable).
2. Show Gilly the diff and ask which fields to write. Each write changes a
   store listing, so it needs his yes for those fields, every time.
3. Apply only the fields he named:
   `python3 .claude/skills/ship-heliofits/scripts/store_sync.py --apply subtitle,promotionalText`
   It refuses a field that is not pending or cannot be written, writes nothing
   in that case, and reads every write back; a mismatch exits 1.

What can be written when: promotional text on the live version at any time;
description, keywords, What's New and the URLs only on a version being
prepared (create the next version record first); name and subtitle only while
an app info is being edited, which App Store Connect opens with a new version.
The tool prints "cannot write: <reason>" for a blocked field. Those state rules
were written from Apple's documented behaviour and are UNCHECKED against the
live API until the first diff run on Gilly's Mac; record the result here.

## Progress tracker — show this after every milestone

Render `scripts/release_status.py` after completing any step below, so Gilly
can follow the release without re-reading the whole conversation. It checks
REAL state (git tags, `gh release view`, the ASC API) rather than trusting
what an earlier turn claimed — the first five milestones (preflight, version
bump, tests, changelog, tag-created) are inherently this session's own
actions and get passed in via `--done`; everything from "tag pushed" onward
is independently verified live:

    python3 .claude/skills/ship-heliofits/scripts/release_status.py <VERSION> <BUILD> \
      --done preflight,tests,changelog

The version milestone is read from `Config/Version.xcconfig`, so `--done version`
is ignored.

Paste its output directly into the response — don't reformat or summarize
it, that defeats the point of a stable, scannable format Gilly can pattern-
match across releases. Show it: after finishing the local pipeline (through
tag+push), after `ship.sh` and the GitHub release, after the App Store
archive/upload, after creating the ASC version and attaching the build,
after setting What's New, and once more after the gated submit/release
steps (which still need Gilly's explicit go-ahead each time regardless of
what the tracker shows as ready).

## Steps

1. **Did `fitsshim.c` change since the last release?**
   `git log --oneline -1 -- HelioFITSExtension/cfitsio/fitsshim.c` vs the last
   release tag. If yes:

       ./HelioFITSExtension/cfitsio/build-universal.sh
       lipo -archs HelioFITSCore/CFITSIO.xcframework/macos-arm64_x86_64/libcfitsio.a   # expect: x86_64 arm64

   This is not optional. `fitsshim.c` is in no Xcode target — it is baked into
   the vendored library, and forgetting this step means editing the shim does
   *nothing* while every test still passes (this shipped silently in 1.3.0).

2. **Clean tree.** `git status --short` — commit or stash anything unexpected
   before touching version numbers.

3. **Bump the version** in its one place, `Config/Version.xcconfig`:

       scripts/bump-version.sh <NEW> <NEWN>
       # refuses NEWN not above the newest v*-build.N tag (exit 1); exit 3 if any
       # mac target resolves other values; prints the commit and tag commands

4. **Run the tests.** `pkill -x HelioFITS` first (never `pkill` again while a
   run is in flight — the test host IS the app, and killing it produces a
   misleading "crashed with signal term" that looks like a real failure):

       xcodebuild test -project HelioFITS.xcodeproj -scheme HelioFITS \
         -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
         DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=UB45PPC2JS CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-" \
         CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual AD_HOC_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=YES
       ./lsclean.sh

   If step 1 rebuilt the library, **also** run on x86_64 (Rosetta) — that
   slice is otherwise never exercised on this Mac:

       xcodebuild test ... -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=x86_64'

5. **Write `CHANGELOG.md`** — new section at the top, Added/Changed/Fixed,
   linked issues, written for the GitHub reader (mechanism, not just
   symptom). See [RELEASING.md](../../../RELEASING.md) step 4 for the
   two-tier convention: the changelog is the long form, the App Store box is
   a separate short pass done later, in App Store Connect, by Gilly.

6. **Commit and tag:**

       git add -A && git commit -m "..."
       git tag -a v<VER>-build.<N> -m "..."
       git push && git push origin v<VER>-build.<N>

7. **Direct-download channel, only when there is a reason** (RELEASING.md "Which
   channels to cut"; otherwise skip steps 7 and 8): `./ship.sh`. The Apple timestamp service
   flakes intermittently — if it fails on `A timestamp was expected but was
   not found`, that is Apple's TSA, not the build. Probe it cheaply before
   blind-retrying:

       clang -o /tmp/tsprobe -x c -; codesign --force --timestamp -o runtime \
         --sign "Developer ID Application: CHRISTOPHER RAYMOND GILBERT (UB45PPC2JS)" /tmp/tsprobe

   If that succeeds, retry `ship.sh`; a short backoff loop (a few attempts,
   tens of seconds apart) is reasonable. If it keeps failing after several
   clean probes, stop and say so rather than looping indefinitely.

8. **Publish the GitHub release**, notes assembled from the CHANGELOG section
   just written plus an install footer (see the pattern in prior releases —
   `gh release view <prior-tag> --json body`):

       gh release create v<VER>-build.<N> build/HelioFITS-<VER>-b<N>.zip \
         --title "HelioFITS <VER> (build <N>)" --notes-file <path>

9. **App Store archive**, straight into the Organizer library so Gilly can
   also drive it by hand if he wants to:

       xcodebuild -project HelioFITS.xcodeproj -scheme HelioFITS \
         -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' \
         -archivePath "$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/HelioFITS <VER> (<N>).xcarchive" archive

   That command does NOT embed the Spotlight importer. The store archive
   carries it since 2026-10-29, so before step 10 either use
   `python3 scripts/release.py archive` instead (it archives into `build/` and
   runs `embed-importer.sh` with `SIGN_ID` read from the archived app's own
   `codesign -dvv` authority), or run
   `SIGN_ID="<the archive app's Authority>" ./embed-importer.sh <archived app>`
   on this one. Verify it is universal and carries the importer
   (`Contents/Library/Spotlight/FITSMetadataImporter.mdimporter`, signed, no
   entitlements): `python3 scripts/release.py verify` checks both for the
   `build/` archive and fails on a missing, unsigned or entitled importer.

10. **Export and upload to App Store Connect** — no password needed, this
    rides on Xcode's already-signed-in account:

        cat > /tmp/exportOptions.plist <<'EOF'
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
        <plist version="1.0"><dict>
            <key>method</key><string>app-store-connect</string>
            <key>destination</key><string>upload</string>
            <key>teamID</key><string>UB45PPC2JS</string>
            <key>signingStyle</key><string>automatic</string>
        </dict></plist>
        EOF
        xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath "<archive path from step 9>" \
          -exportOptionsPlist /tmp/exportOptions.plist -exportPath /tmp/hf-export

    If this fails with an account/team error, that's the Xcode account
    session, not this pipeline — check Xcode ▸ Settings ▸ Accounts. A recent
    Apple ID password change invalidates it; re-add the account (2FA re-auth
    is Gilly's, not automatable).

11. **Hand off.** Tell Gilly plainly: code is shipped, GitHub release is
    live, build N is uploaded and Processing in App Store Connect. He still
    needs to (a) create/select the version record, (b) attach the build once
    Processing finishes, (c) write the short-form What's New, (d) confirm
    screenshots, (e) Add for Review then Submit to Review — two separate
    buttons on two pages. Don't say "shipped" or "live" for the store channel
    until he's done that.

## Things that have actually gone wrong here before

Real dated incidents. Append, never delete. This section is the reason the
runbook is worth more than the commands it contains.

- **2026-08-20 — the stale library.** Edited `fitsshim.c`, committed, tests
  green, shipped 1.3.0 announcing an ASPIICS colormap feature that could
  never execute: the file is in no Xcode target and the vendored
  `libcfitsio.a` had not been rebuilt since 07-15. The purpose-built contract
  test passed because it grepped the `.c` **source**, not the built artifact.
  Cost an entire extra release (1.3.1). Guard: `HeaderKeyContractTests` now
  reads the built library, verified by running it against the old one and
  watching it fail. See step 1.
- **2026-08-21 — the unclicked button.** "Open a Finder Window" had never
  worked in any sandboxed build since 1.2; it handed `$HOME` to
  `NSWorkspace.open`, which App Sandbox refuses. Two simulated review panels
  examined that screen and missed it, because reading code and viewing a
  screenshot both fall short of pressing the button. Guard: none automatic —
  press user-facing controls in a real build before shipping them.
- **2026-08-22 — the unsubmitted build.** Build 8 was archived, validated,
  and described as ready; a later session assumed "ready" meant "submitted".
  It wasn't. Guard: the tracker's `submitted` milestone reads the live
  `appStoreState` from the ASC API, so it cannot be assumed.
- **2026-08-21 — retry-by-reflex on the timestamp server.** Four archives
  failed on `A timestamp was expected but was not found`. Signing twelve
  throwaway binaries measured it in seconds: one-in-three failing, then
  zero-in-twelve minutes later — Apple's TSA was degraded and recovered.
  Because `ship.sh` signs ~10 binaries, a modest per-signature rate makes
  nearly every archive fail. Guard: probe the TSA before burning archive
  cycles (step 7).
- **2026-09-24 — the test build that caught a real file.** Launching a Debug
  build from DerivedData to check new windows registered it with
  LaunchServices, and a FITS file Gilly double-clicked in Finder opened in the
  test build instead of his App Store copy. A test of the Finder sync dialog
  (`open -a <debug app> heliofits://choose?...`) was also answered with Apply
  and wrote a real folder rule into the shared app-group settings. Guard: run
  `./lsclean.sh` immediately after every test launch, keep test launches
  short, and never trigger a dialog whose default button writes to the shared
  settings.
- **2026-09-27 — expired Apple sign-ins, twice over.** For 1.4.0 the notary
  profile returned 401 and Xcode had no Apple account signed in at all, so
  the App Store export failed with "Failed to Use Accounts". The upload went
  through by passing the ASC API key to `xcodebuild -exportArchive`
  (`-authenticationKeyPath/-authenticationKeyID/-authenticationKeyIssuerID`).
  Re-storing the notary profile needs the developer Apple ID, which is NOT
  gillygumption@gmail.com ("account does not exist"). Guard: check
  `xcrun notarytool history --keychain-profile HelioFITS-notary` before step 7.
- **2026-09-27 — a notarization that never finished.** The first 1.4.0
  submission sat "In Progress" for over three hours (and `notarytool --wait`
  crashed with a bus error). Resubmitting the same zip was Accepted in about a
  minute. Guard: if a submission is still in progress after ~15 minutes,
  resubmit with `--wait --timeout 8m` instead of waiting it out.
- `pkill -x HelioFITS` while a test run is in flight — the test host IS the
  app, so this fails the run with "crashed with signal term", which reads as
  a real failure and is not.
- Assuming an Xcode archive is MAS-clean without checking for the Spotlight
  importer — `ship.sh`'s embed step runs on Channel B builds only, so a plain
  Xcode archive for the Store should never have it, but confirm each time.
  (Superseded 2026-10-29: the store archive now MUST carry the importer, see the
  last entry; a plain Xcode archive is the one that is missing it.)
- **2026-09-29: the runbook pointed at files that had moved.** Step 1 told an
  agent to `lipo` `HelioFITSExtension/cfitsio/libcfitsio.a`, which has not existed
  since the library moved into `HelioFITSCore/CFITSIO.xcframework` (#31); the API
  section linked a `references/asc-api.md` that was never written; and step 7
  ran `ship.sh` on every release although RELEASING.md cuts the direct channel
  only when there is a reason. Found by a plan verifier reading this file against
  origin/main. Guard: the lines were corrected in place, and the repo-root
  `CLAUDE.md` names the current paths.
- **2026-10-29: the importer ban that was never a rejection.** In 2026-07 the
  store build was told to carry no Spotlight importer (CLAUDE.md, check.sh,
  `store_sync.py` lint, STORE.md, `release.py verify`). That was a self-imposed
  risk flag, not an App Review rejection: Review has never seen an importer in
  this app, and the one rejection so far (5.2.5, 2026-07-27) was about the
  subtitle. Evidence for lifting it: on 2026-10-29 a Release archive of
  origin/main 41f9c77 (labelled 1.5.1 (13) on the command line), with the
  importer embedded by `SIGN_ID="Apple Development: ..." ./embed-importer.sh
  <archived app>`, exported as app-store-connect (importer re-signed Apple
  Distribution, no entitlements on the importer, app sandboxed), passed
  `xcrun altool --validate-app` with "No errors validating archive" and no
  warnings. Precedent: Apple's GarageBand from the Mac App Store ships two
  `.mdimporter` bundles in `Contents/Library/Spotlight`; Apple's docs say a
  Spotlight File Import extension adds nothing to Spotlight on macOS and point
  to a Spotlight importer plug-in for custom files. Decision: Gilly chose on
  2026-10-29 that the 1.5.1 store build carries the importer. App Review has not
  seen it (UNCHECKED until it does). Consequence: `release.py archive` embeds
  it and `release.py verify` requires it, so the new way to get this wrong is a
  hand-made Xcode Organizer archive, which has none. Guard: `verify` fails on
  a store app without it; the 4.2 response in RELEASING.md describes it.
