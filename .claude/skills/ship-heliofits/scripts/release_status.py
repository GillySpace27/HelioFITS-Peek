"""Render the ship-heliofits progress tracker from VERIFIED state.

Checks git, GitHub and the App Store Connect API directly rather than
trusting what an earlier turn claimed to have done -- the same discipline
that caught the stale-libcfitsio.a bug in 1.3.0. The first five milestones
(preflight/version/tests/changelog/tag-created) are inherently about this
session's own actions and can't be re-derived from outside state, so they
are passed in by the caller; everything from "tag pushed" onward is checked
live.

The "version" milestone is the exception: it is read from Config/Version.xcconfig
(the one mac version source, HF-10), so --done version is ignored.

Usage: python3 release_status.py [<VERSION> <BUILD>] [--done preflight,tests,changelog]
  With no VERSION, follows the release Config/Version.xcconfig names, and derives
  preflight, tests and changelog from the tag and CHANGELOG.md (suite SU-5), so
  the Orrery registry needs neither a pinned version nor --done.
