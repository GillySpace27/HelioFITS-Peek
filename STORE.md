# HelioFITS Peek: App Store listing copy

Paste-ready text for App Store Connect. Name **HelioFITS** (clear on the Mac App
Store as of 2026‑07‑12 — only "QuickFits", CloudMakers' "FITS Preview", and the
unrelated "Helio Fit" fitness app exist). Do NOT ship as "FITS Quick Look"
(confusable with QuickFits; Apple may reject "Quick Look" in an app name).

Primary category: **Utilities**. It is a Quick Look extension, a thumbnail
generator; its job is teaching Finder a file type. (The Mac App Store build has no Spotlight importer.)

## Name (30 char max)

```
HelioFITS Peek
```

> The App Store name. Gilly chose HelioFITS Peek on 2026-10-24 (the site has used it
> since 2026-10-13); the live listing reads HelioFITS until `store_sync.py` pushes this
> (see the ship-heliofits skill). Change it here, then run `store_sync.py`.

## Subtitle (30 char max)

```
Instant solar FITS previews
```

> **Do not put "Finder" (or any Apple product/service name) in the subtitle.**
> Submission 1.2 (6) was rejected 2026‑07‑27 under **Guideline 5.2.5 — Legal:
> Intellectual Property** for exactly that: the subtitle read *"Solar FITS
> previews in Finder"*. Apple treats the name/subtitle as branding real estate,
> so Apple trademarks are not allowed there. Referential use in the **description
> body** ("works with Finder", "teaches Finder to read…") was NOT flagged and is
> normal practice — only the subtitle had to change.
>
> Alternates that fit: `Preview solar FITS files` (24) ·
> `Solar FITS previews on Mac` (26) · `See your solar FITS instantly` (29)

Press Space on a FITS file and see the Sun, in the right colormap, with real helioprojective coordinates under the cursor. For the archive already sitting on your disk.
```

## Description

```
HelioFITS Peek teaches Finder to read solar FITS files.

Press Space on any .fits file and it renders instantly — in the correct
instrument colormap, drawn from the sunpy standard. SDO/AIA, HMI magnetograms,
LASCO, SUVI, EIT, STEREO, PUNCH, K-Cor, TRACE, XRT and more are recognized from
the header; nothing to configure.

Built by a solar physicist, for the archive already sitting on your disk.

COORDINATES YOU CAN TRUST
Hover any pixel and read its value together with its helioprojective coordinate
(Tx, Ty) and its distance from disk center in solar radii. The world-coordinate
solution does the real spherical deprojection — TAN, ARC, SIN and CAR — honors
CUNIT, the PC and CD matrices and CROTA2, and is pinned against astropy in the
test suite. It refuses to guess: a projection it cannot handle produces no
readout rather than a plausible wrong number.

MEASURE WITHOUT LEAVING FINDER
Drag a box to get mean, median, sigma, sum, min and max over the region at full
native resolution, with a histogram. Toggle the solar limb. Adjust the stretch
live — percentile clip, gamma, log — without touching the file.

MULTI-EXTENSION FILES, HANDLED
Scroll to blink between HDUs, pixel-registered, to compare processing levels or
filters. Overlay a running difference. Pin which HDU a folder should show —
first, last, or a specific one — and every preview, thumbnail and icon follows.
Rice-compressed and .fz files work natively.

METADATA AT A GLANCE
Telescope, instrument, wavelength, observation date, exposure, dimensions and
HDU count appear in the viewer's header pane and in the Quick Look preview.

BACK TO PYTHON IN ONE CLICK
Copy a sunpy snippet that loads exactly the HDU you are looking at. Export any
HDU to PNG for slides and papers, or convert a whole folder at once.

Free. No account, no network, no telemetry. HelioFITS Peek has no network
entitlement, so the macOS sandbox denies it all internet access. It only ever
reads the files you point it at.

HelioFITS Peek previews solar FITS files in Finder and Quick Look. HelioFITS Studio,
a separate free download, is the full desktop application for working with
coronagraph and wide-field solar imagery.

## App Review notes

```
HelioFITS Peek is a Quick Look preview extension and thumbnail extension for FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files, the standard data
format in astronomy.

To see it work, open any .fits file in Finder and press Space, or double-click it
to open the built-in viewer. Sample solar FITS files are freely available from
https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/ — or use the file attached to this submission.

The app has no accounts, no network access, and no data collection of any kind.

## Screenshots

macOS requires 1280×800, 1440×900, 2560×1600 or 2880×1800. Up to 10.
Generated by `make-screenshots.sh` into `screenshots/<VER>/` (git-ignored, one folder per version, never wiped by a script).
`scripts/app-store-shots.sh` retakes the whole set in this order (`--dry-run` lists the steps).

Suggested set, in order:
1. Quick Look preview of an AIA or PUNCH frame with the coordinate readout visible
2. Finder gallery/icon view — a folder of FITS files with colored thumbnails
3. The viewer window with the header beneath and the stretch panel open
4. The viewer's header pane showing the metadata rows

---

## Positioning

HelioFITS serves calibrated solar science data, where the colormap and header
metadata carry physical meaning. It complements — not competes with —
astrophotography tools like QuickFits (debayer camera frames, export TIFF):
different jobs, both good tools. We adopt the canonical `gov.nasa.gsfc.fits`
type so they coexist on one Mac.

## Price

Free.
