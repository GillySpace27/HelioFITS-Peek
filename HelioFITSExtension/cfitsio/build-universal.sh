# Rebuild the vendored universal (arm64 + x86_64) CFITSIO from source, as
# HelioFITSCore/CFITSIO.xcframework.
#
# The app links this ONE static library; it must be a fat binary so HelioFITS
# Peek ships as a universal app that runs on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. The
# custom fitsshim.c is baked into the archive (the app calls fitsshim_* directly),
# so it is compiled per-arch and `ar r`'d into each slice before the lipo.
#
# Run this after editing fitsshim.c, or to move to a new CFITSIO version. It must
# run on an Apple Silicon Mac with Rosetta 2 installed (the x86_64 slice is built
# with `clang -arch x86_64`; its configure test programs run under Rosetta).
#
#   ./build-universal.sh          # uses CFITSIO_VERSION below
#
# The tarball must match CFITSIO_SHA256 or nothing is built. The xcframework it
# replaces is copied to build-attic/CFITSIO.xcframework-<UTC>/ first (git-ignored,
# never pruned), and HelioFITSCore/CFITSIO.stamp records what was baked in.
# scripts/check.sh checks the header copies in the xcframework
# (check_shim_header_copies) and compares the stamp with CFITSIO_VERSION,
# CFITSIO_SHA256 and the current fitsshim.c and fitsshim.h (check_cfitsio_stamp,
# HF-6 Task 7), so an edited shim fails the check until this script runs again.

# the session that wrote this could not reach HEASARC; cross-check it once on a Mac:

# Change the two lines together. Fuzz/build.sh reads both with sed, so keep each
