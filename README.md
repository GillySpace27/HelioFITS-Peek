Do you have a hundred directories of FITS files and no way to preview them
without launching a heavy application for each one? On the left above, every file
is the same grey icon — you can't tell an EUV frame from a magnetogram without
opening each one. On the right is the same folder with HelioFITS installed. That's
the whole idea.

**HelioFITS Peek teaches Finder to read solar FITS files.** Once it's installed, your
`.fits` files stop being rows of identical grey document icons and become what
they actually are — the Sun, rendered in the correct instrument colormap. Press
the spacebar on any of them and you get an interactive preview with pixel values,
helioprojective coordinates, region statistics, and multi-HDU blink comparison,
without opening anything.

It's built by a solar physicist, for the archive already sitting on your disk. It
recognizes SDO/AIA, HMI magnetograms, LASCO, SUVI, EIT, STEREO, PUNCH, K‑Cor,
TRACE, and XRT straight from the header — nothing to configure. There is no
account, no telemetry, and no network access of any kind.

## Three ways it makes Finder understand FITS

HelioFITS is three small system extensions plus a viewer. Each lights up a
different part of macOS, and they all work together — no app window required.

### 1 · Thumbnails, on every icon

<img src="docs/colormaps.png" width="640" alt="Finder icon view of solar FITS files, each a distinct colormap"/>

The thumbnail extension renders each FITS file's default image in the colormap its
header calls for — AIA gold, a diverging red/blue magnetogram, a LASCO coronagraph,
a PUNCH heliospheric mosaic. Icon view, gallery view, the icons in list and column
views: all of them show the real image. A directory of solar data becomes browsable
the way a folder of photos is.

### 2 · Interactive previews, from the spacebar

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/preview-quicklook.png" alt="A Quick Look preview of an AIA image with the pixel value and coordinate readout, the RHEF filter, and the Limb/Diff/Stretch controls"/></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/interactive-stats.png" alt="The preview with the solar limb drawn and a region selected for statistics"/></td>
</tr>
</table>

Select a `.fits` file and press the **spacebar** — the standard macOS Quick Look —
and HelioFITS draws the image live. This is not a static picture; it's fully
interactive in the spacebar panel and gallery view. (Finder's narrow column pane
gives you scroll‑to‑blink; press space there for the full controls.)

- **Hover** any pixel to read its value together with its *helioprojective*
  coordinate — **Tx, Ty**, the arcsecond offset east/west and north/south from the
  center of the Sun's disk — and its distance from disk center in solar radii (**R☉**).
- **Drag a box** for region statistics — mean, median, σ, sum, min, max — computed
  at full native resolution, with a live histogram.
- **Scroll** (or press **↑/↓**) to blink between HDUs (a FITS file's stacked image
  extensions), pixel‑registered, to compare processing levels or filters.
- **Toggle** the solar limb, a running difference between HDUs, a live stretch
  (percentile clip, gamma, log), or the **RHEF** filter — a radial histogram
  equalization ([Gilly & Cranmer 2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-025-02578-x))
  that flattens the steep coronal falloff to reveal faint off‑limb structure at
  every height. None of it touches the file.
- Pick **MGN** (multi‑scale Gaussian normalization, Morgan & Druckmüller 2014, with
  sunkit‑image's default widths) or **WOW** (wavelet whitening after Auchère et al.
  2023, in HelioFITS's own reading; not checked against the authors' `watroo` package)
  to bring out structure at every scale. **Swipe** puts the unfiltered image left of a
  divider and the filter right of it; drag it, or press **⌥←/⌥→**.
  Every filter runs on a grid of at most 1024 px a side; MGN and WOW divide their
  widths by that decimation, so the preview approximates the full‑resolution filter.
  Filter output is a visualization, not a calibrated radiance; the readout and the
  statistics always report the file's raw values. Copy Python reproduces each filter.
- **⌥‑scroll** (or **⌘ +/−/0**) to zoom.

The coordinate math is computed the same way astropy and sunpy do it, and verified
against astropy pixel‑for‑pixel in the test suite — so you can trust the numbers. (For
the experts: real spherical deprojection for TAN/ARC/SIN/CAR, honoring CUNIT, the
PC/CD matrices, and CROTA2.) When it meets a projection it can't handle, it shows no
coordinate rather than a plausible wrong one.

### 3 · Metadata, in Get Info and Spotlight

<img src="docs/spotlight-metadata.png" width="640" alt="A Finder Get Info panel showing telescope, instrument, wavelength and other FITS metadata"/>

The Spotlight importer pulls the header fields you actually search on — telescope,
instrument, wavelength, observation date, exposure, dimensions, HDU count — into
Finder's **Get Info** panel and makes them Spotlight‑searchable. You can find every
171 Å frame on your disk with a query.

### And a viewer, when you want more

<img src="docs/viewer.png" width="640" alt="The HelioFITS viewer window showing an image above the full FITS header"/>

Double‑click a FITS file to open the built‑in viewer: the interactive image on top,
the complete FITS header beneath. From here you can **export any HDU to PNG** for a
slide or a paper, or **copy a ready‑to‑run sunpy snippet** that loads exactly the
HDU you're looking at — a one‑click bridge back to Python.

**Play** runs a file's layers as a looping movie. Open a **folder** (File ▸ Open…)
and its FITS files become one: frames in DATE‑OBS order, a scrubber, a frame rate,
and Diff as a running difference between neighbouring files, taken at full
resolution. Nothing plays until you press Play.

## Install

> **Runs on any Mac** — Apple Silicon or Intel — with macOS 14.5 or later. It's a
> universal binary.

### [**Get it on the Mac App Store →**](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6790952544)

That's the whole install: it's free, it updates itself, and macOS registers the
Finder extensions for you. Then press the **spacebar** on any `.fits` file. (If a
thumbnail still looks generic at first, relaunch Finder or log out and back in —
macOS caches icons.)

<details>
<summary>If you can't use the App Store</summary>

Some managed and institutional Macs block it. The notarized build is also attached
to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/GillySpace27/HelioFITS/releases):
download the zip, unzip it, drag `HelioFITS.app` into `/Applications`, and launch it
once so the extensions register. It opens without security warnings, but it does
**not** self-update — watch the
[releases feed](https://github.com/GillySpace27/HelioFITS/releases.atom) for new
versions. The App Store is the supported channel; this is a fallback.

</details>

### Getting FITS files to try

The repo ships no data. Any solar `.fits` file works — free sources include
[SDO data](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/), the
[Virtual Solar Observatory](https://sdac.virtualsolar.org/),
[PUNCH](https://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/punch/), and
[sunpy's Fido](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/tutorial/acquiring_data/).
`.fz` (fpack) and Rice‑compressed files work natively.

## Settings

<img src="docs/settings.png" width="640" alt="The HelioFITS Settings panel: a Default HDU picker, an Open File with Viewer button, and per-folder HDU pinning rules"/>

Open **HelioFITS ▸ Settings…** (⌘,). A FITS file can stack several images as
separate **Header Data Units (HDUs)** — also called *extensions*, each labelled by
its `EXTNAME` (say, a raw frame, a processed layer, and an uncertainty map).
HelioFITS shows the first image HDU by default; the settings panel lets you change
that globally, or **pin a folder** to a specific HDU so an entire directory previews
the same layer for apples‑to‑apples comparison.

## Supported instruments

AIA · HMI (line‑of‑sight magnetograms and synoptic B_r charts) · LASCO C2/C3 ·
SUVI · EIT · STEREO/SECCHI (EUVI, COR, HI) · PUNCH (including its polarized Stokes
cubes — a stack of polarization measurements in one file) · K‑Cor · TRACE · XRT.
Instrument is recognized from `TELESCOP`/`INSTRUME`/`DETECTOR`; anything
unrecognized falls back to a sensible grayscale stretch. Missing one?
[Open an issue](https://github.com/GillySpace27/HelioFITS/issues) — colormaps are
easy to add.

## Accessibility

The **viewer** window is keyboard‑ and VoiceOver‑friendly: the HDU picker and
Copy/Save buttons are labeled and reachable, the FITS header is a selectable,
VoiceOver‑navigable, ⌘F‑searchable text pane, and in the image the **↑/↓** arrows
blink between layers, **⌘ +/−/0** zoom, and **⌘C** copies the pixel readout. Toolbar
toggles announce their name and on/off state. Work still to do: a keyboard cursor
for the hover readout and drag‑box statistics (today those are mouse‑driven), and
honoring the system Larger‑Text setting. Feedback from assistive‑technology users is
very welcome via the issue tracker.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue: <https://github.com/GillySpace27/HelioFITS/issues>. Attaching (or
linking) a FITS file that reproduces the problem makes fixes much faster. If a
readout ever disagrees with what sunpy tells you, I especially want to know.

## Building from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GillySpace27/HelioFITS.git
cd HelioFITS
xcodebuild -project HelioFITS.xcodeproj -scheme HelioFITS -configuration Release \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' build
```

The app is universal (Apple Silicon and Intel): the vendored CFITSIO library in
`HelioFITSCore/CFITSIO.xcframework` carries both Mac slices, and
`lipo -archs HelioFITSCore/CFITSIO.xcframework/macos-arm64_x86_64/libcfitsio.a`
prints `x86_64 arm64`. The core tests (the WCS math pinned against astropy ground
truth, colormaps, cubes, RHEF, the readout) live under
`HelioFITSCore/Tests/HelioFITSCoreTests/` and run headless with
`swift test --package-path HelioFITSCore`, without launching the app. Tests that need
the app (canvas, toolbar, stretch panel, header reader) live under `HelioFITSTests/`;
run them with the scheme's Test action, then
`./lsclean.sh`. `ship.sh` documents the notarized release flow and `RELEASING.md`
the full two-channel process. Contributors and coding agents start at `CLAUDE.md`;
`bash scripts/check.sh` runs the fast static checks.

### iPhone and iPad (in development)

`HelioFITS-iOS/` holds an iPhone and iPad app that shares `HelioFITSCore` with the
Mac: thumbnails and Quick Look previews in the Files app, and an interactive
viewer. It is not on the App Store yet, keeps its own version number, and has
been tested in the Simulator only. Build it with:

```sh
xcodebuild -project HelioFITS-iOS/HelioFITS-iOS.xcodeproj -scheme HelioFITS \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

## Command line

The renderer behind the thumbnails and previews is also a small command-line
tool, for scripts and SSH sessions. It is built from source only; it is not part
of the App Store app or the GitHub zip.

```sh
swift build -c release --package-path HelioFITSCore
HelioFITSCore/.build/release/heliofits --header sun.fits
HelioFITSCore/.build/release/heliofits --info sun.fits
HelioFITSCore/.build/release/heliofits --export sun.fits --hdu 1 --max-side 2048 --out sun.png
```

`--hdu` defaults to the first image HDU (`-1`; `-2` is the last), `--plane`
picks a plane of a data cube, and `--max-side` caps the longest side of the PNG.
The tool makes no network calls. Exit status is 0 on success, 1 when the file
cannot be read or rendered, and 2 on a usage error.

## Privacy

HelioFITS collects nothing and has **no network entitlement** — the macOS sandbox
denies it all internet access, so nothing can leave your Mac. No accounts, no
analytics, no telemetry. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Citing

If HelioFITS helps your research, please cite the version you used. Each release
is archived on Zenodo with its own DOI; [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff) has the
details, and GitHub's "Cite this repository" button turns it into APA or BibTeX.
If you used the RHEF filter, please also cite Gilly & Cranmer (2025),
