// swift-tools-version:5.10
// The platform-neutral half of HelioFITS Peek: reading FITS (CFITSIO + fitsshim),
// solar WCS, colormaps, stretch, RHEF, and rendering to CGImage/PNG. No AppKit,
// no Quick Look: the Mac app, its two extensions, and a future iOS app all link it.
// Language mode 5, same as the app targets.
