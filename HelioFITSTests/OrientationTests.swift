//
//  OrientationTests.swift — the displayed image must not be upside down.
//
//  HelioFITS Peek 1.2 (then named HelioFITS) shipped to the App Store drawing EVERY image vertically
//  flipped. `render()` bakes the pixels correctly (north up, which is why
//  "Save PNG" was always right), but FITSImageCanvas is a flipped view and the
//  plain `NSImage.draw(in:)` ignores that, so the canvas inverted it. Nobody
//  noticed for weeks because a full-disk AIA or PUNCH frame is near enough to
//  symmetric that the eye cannot tell. David Berghmans (PI, Solar Orbiter/EUI)
//  caught it on an FSI image with a polar coronal hole and a one-sided
//  eruption, and correctly deduced that the readout disagreed with the display.
//
//  See issue #11. The fix is `respectFlipped: true` on the draw call.
