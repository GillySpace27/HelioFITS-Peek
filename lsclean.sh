# LaunchServices hygiene — run after ANY build that produces a HelioFITS Peek.app.
#
# This is the most recurring bug in the project, so it lives in one script that
# ship.sh and every local install loop call.
#
# xcodebuild silently registers each app copy it builds:
#   - `archive` registers build/HelioFITS.xcarchive/Products/Applications/…
#     AND DerivedData/…/ArchiveIntermediates/…
#   - `test`    registers DerivedData/…/Build/Products/Debug/HelioFITS Peek.app
# Any dangling one can hijack QuickLook THUMBNAIL generation: the ThumbnailsAgent
# latches a stale appex path, every launch then fails with
#   "Extension … not found in LS database"
# and Finder falls back to the generic document icon. Preview keeps working
# (different agent), so "previews fine + thumbnails generic" is the signature.
#
# Fix: make /Applications the ONLY registered copy, then poke the caches.

# 1. Unregister every copy that is not the installed one.
#
#    Ask the LS database what it actually knows about rather than guessing where
#    a stray copy might be: any -derivedDataPath (including a throwaway one under
#    /tmp), an .xcarchive, a Trashed copy. Guessing is how this bug kept coming
#    back — the previous globs only covered ~/Library/Developer and ./build, so a
#    build anywhere else re-latched the ThumbnailsAgent silently.
